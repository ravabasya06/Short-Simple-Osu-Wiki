          <p>Osu! (stylized as osu!) is a free-to-play rhythm game primarily developed, published, and created by Dean "peppy" Herbert. Inspired by iNiS' rhythm game Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, it was written in <code>C#</code> on the <code>.NET Framework</code>, and was released for Microsoft Windows on 16 September 2007. The game has throughout the years been ported to <code>macOS</code>, <code>Linux</code>, <code>Android</code> and <code>iOS</code>.</p>
          <p>Aside from Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, the game has been inspired by titles such as Taiko no Tatsujin, Beatmania IIDX,EZ2DJ (EZ2CATCH), Elite Beat Agents, O2Jam, StepMania and DJMax. All beatmaps in the game are community-made through the in-game map editor. Four different game modes exist, offering various ways to play a beatmap, which can also be combined with addable modifiers, increasing or decreasing the difficulty. The more difficult, the more combo and accuracy you have more pp (performance points) which makes you go higher in the maps leaderboards and your global rank.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="gameplay">
          <header><h1>Gameplay</h1></header>
          <p>There are four official game modes: "osu!" (called "osu!standard"), "osu!taiko", "osu!catch", and "osu!mania". The original osu!standard mode remains the most popular to date and as of March 2022, the game has over 19.3 million monthly active users according to the game's global country leaderboards.</p>
          <p>Each mode offers a variety of "beatmaps", which are game levels that are played to songs of different lengths, ranging from "TV sized" anime openings to "marathons" surpassing 7 minutes. In osu!standard, beatmaps consist of three items – hit circles, sliders, and spinners. The goal of the game is for the player to click on these items in time to the music. These items are collectively known as "hit objects" or "circles", and are arranged in different positions on the screen (except for the spinner) at different points of time during a song. Taiko beatmaps have drumbeats and spinners. Catch beatmaps have fruits and spinners, which are arranged in a horizontally falling manner. Mania beatmaps consist of keys (depicted as a small bar) and holds. The beatmap is then played with accompanying music, simulating a sense of rhythm as the player interacts with the objects to the beat of the music. Each beatmap is accompanied by music and a background. The game can be played using various peripherals: the most common setup is a graphics tablet or computer mouse to control cursor movement, paired with a keyboard or a mini keyboard with only two keys, while the game's auto function (where the game itself plays the beatmap as accurate as possible) uses only the mouse to play osu!standard beatmaps, and only the keyboard for osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania beatmaps.</p>

          <header><h1>Beatmap</h1></header>
          <p>osu! has five different beatmap categories:
            <ul>
              <li>"Ranked & Approved" – a community-generated beatmap approved for play by Beatmap Nominators, or BN. These maps give performance points (pp) which made players to move up in the global player rankings. The leaderboard always shows the global top 50 leaderboard.
              <li>"Qualified" – a beatmap that is on its way to ranking. Beatmaps will remain "Qualified" for 1 week, after which they will be ranked. Beatmaps in "Qualified" will be disqualified and beatmap status reset to "Pending" if problems are found that are not related to the osu! ranking criteria. They don't value performance points, but they do show leaderboards.
              <li>“Loved” – a beatmap that received significant acclaim from the community and was approved for play. They only show beatmap leaderboards. This leaderboard can be reset by the beatmap maker. The loved beatmap doesn't give any performance points.
              <li>"Pending" and "WIP" – beatmaps that are not fully completed or waiting to be rated. They don't have leaderboards and don't give any performance points.
              <li>"Graveyard" – a beatmap that hasn't received an update for more than 28 days. Just like pending beatmaps, they don't have leaderboards and don't award performance points.
              <li>"Not submitted" – a beatmap that is still under development and has not yet been sent to osu! website for ranking status. Beatmaps like this can only be accessed by people who have .osz files (osu beatmap files!).
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Ranking maps are hard, because you have to fulfill the osu! ranking criteria</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="features">
          <header><h1>Features</h1></header>
          <p>The game offers a buyable service called osu!supporter, which grants extra features to the user. osu!supporter does not affect the ranking system, or provide any in-game advantage. While osu!supporter itself is not a recurring service (meaning it is a one-off payment), it has a limited time validity ranging from 1 month to 2 years; however, multiple purchases of osu!supporter service time can be entitled to one user, allowing for longer uninterrupted service.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="community_events">
          <header><h1>Community Events</h1></header>
          <p>Osu! and its players have organized different events, such as fanart and beatmapping contests, and conventions. The biggest unofficial event held in the community is "cavoe's osu! event" (usually referred to as "osu! event" or "COE"), held at The Brabanthallen in Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands. The event has been arranged three times since 2017 yearly. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 and 2021 editions of the event were cancelled. COE 2022, the most recent event, took place from 1 to 7 August. There were also official stands at TwitchCon and Anime Expo.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="tournaments">
          <header><h1>Tournaments</h1></header>
          <p>Osu! contains three main facets of competition between players. In multiplayer lobbies, up to 16 users play a map simultaneously. On individual maps, players compete for highscores on global leaderboards or against highscores set by themselves and friends. Players also compete with their ranks, which are calculated by accumulating "performance points" (pp). pp is based on a map's difficulty and the player's performance on it. In July 2019, a player, Vaxei, exceeded 1,000pp for the first time, followed by another player, idke, less than twenty-four hours later.</p>
          <p>Starting in 2011, there have been twelve annual Osu! World Cups (usually abbreviated as OWC), one for each game mode (osu!mania having two for four key and seven key). Teams for World Cups are country-based, with up to eight players per team. There are also very many different community-hosted tournaments, differing in rank range, types of maps played, and how the teams are composed. Winners of larger official tournaments typically receive prizes such as cash, merchandise, profile badges and/or osu!supporter subscriptions. For this reason, large tournaments often attract high skill level players as well as large audiences on Twitch, this is in contrast to the smaller community tournaments which often have small or no prizes and are not watched by many people. These smaller tournaments comprise the vast majority of all Osu! tournaments, and through the usage of global rank entry restrictions where you may only compete against players in your own rank range, community tournaments provide a serious competitive environment for players who may not be highly skilled. Without these community tournaments, players would have to practice for years to have any shot at serious competitive play.</p>
